Introduction
============

This is a simple export of my iTerm2 configuration so I can quickly get it back on another computer. It requires the [vim-monaco-webdevicons](https://github.com/nicholasc/vim-monaco-webdevicons) to be installed on the system.

Usage
============

You can either checkout the repo and point the config folder to it or point directly to the url:
